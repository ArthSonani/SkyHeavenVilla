This folder should contain image and video assets used by the app (e.g., photo2.jpg, farm360.mp4).
Binary files were not copied automatically. To finish the move, either:

1) Move all files from `frontend/src/assets/` into this folder using your OS/file explorer or `mv` in a terminal.
2) Or tell me and I'll move them for you.

Files expected in this folder (from original project):
- previous_logo.png
- photo2.jpg
- photo3.jpg
- photo4.jpg
- photo5.jpg
- photo6.jpg
- photo7.jpg
- logo.png
- farm180.mp4
- farm360.mp4
